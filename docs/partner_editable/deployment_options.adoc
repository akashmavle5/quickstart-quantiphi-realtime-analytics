This Quick Start provides two deployment options:
•	Deploy Real-time Analytics into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment). This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys Real-time Analytics into this new VPC.
•	Deploy Real-time Analytics into an existing VPC. This option provisions Real-time analytics in your existing AWS infrastructure.
The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and Real-time Analytics settings, as discussed later in this guide.
