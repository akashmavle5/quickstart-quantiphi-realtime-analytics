==== Prepare for the deployment

Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in the Region where the Quick Start is deployed. Save the key pair name, as you need it during deployment. To create a key pair, follow the instructions in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances^]. For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair.
