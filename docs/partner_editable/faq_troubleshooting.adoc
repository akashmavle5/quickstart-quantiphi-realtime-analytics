== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and you can troubleshoot the issue. 

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Ensure that you delete stack after troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

== Troubleshooting

*Q.* I encountered an error message that the maximum number of addresses has been reached.

*A.* This message is displayed when you reach the elastic IP address limit in your AWS account for a particular Region. Check your current limit and request a quota increase if necessary. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* I encountered a "Received 1 FAILURE signal(s) out of 2. Unable to satisfy 50% MinSuccessfulInstancesPercent requirement" error in WebAppDeploymentStack when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* If you deployed the templates into an existing VPC, check that all outbound connections are enabled in the network access control list (ACL). If so, then find the event with the following parameters in WebAppDeploymentStack:

* LogicalId: WebAppAutoScalingGroup
* Status: +CREATE_FAILED+ 
* Status reason: Received FAILURE signal with UniqueId <instance-id>

Use the configured bastion host to connect using SSH into the instance and check the /var/log/cfn-init.log file for more details.

For more information on how to use bastion hosts to connect using SSH to instances in a private subnet, see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securely-connect-to-linux-instances-running-in-a-private-amazon-vpc/[Securely Connect to Linux Instances Running in a Private Amazon VPC^].
