{partner-product-name} on AWS transcribes live calls coming from an integrated PBX system. The transcription, and keywords and entities extracted from it, are displayed live to call center agents in a custom user interface. Entities include customer name, date of birth, customer ID, and callback phone number. The deployment also performs a post-call analysis to summarize a call. Agents can replay calls, download transcriptions and keywords, and jump to sections of a recording by choosing keywords. Call transcripts, keywords, and metadata are stored in Amazon DynamoDB tables, and can be used as resources later to perform further analytics.
