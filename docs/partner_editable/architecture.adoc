As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:


1.The call stream between customer and the agent / provider will be received from Issabel PBX to Amazon Chime Voice Connector in two different streams.

2.The chime voice connector streams the audio streams into Kinesis Video Streams

3.The streams of the two speakers trigger the two Event Bridges simultaneously.

4.Each event bridge writes the call metadata and the stream details into the respective SQS queues at the start and the end of the call.

5.SQS queues, triggers the Transcription lambda function.This lambda function reads the audio streams from Kinesis and makes a call to AWS Transcribe.

6.The Transcription Lambda also writes the transcript data into the DynamoDB table and publishes a message to post processing SQS Queue. This lambda also stores the mp3 file after call completion to the S3 bucket.

7.Post processing SQS triggers the post processing Lambda (keyword-extraction) function. Here the transcripts are cleaned and key words are extracted using string matching. The results are stored into a DynamoDB table.

8.Post processing Lambda also publishes the transcripts and the keyword data to the Customer User Interface via the Websockets.

9.When the call ends, we receive a SQS message for both the streams through the eventbridge rule. A metadata Lambda function will be triggered by this SQS queue. In this Lambda we extract the entities from the transcripts using custom entity extraction logic and Amazon Comprehend.  This lambda notifies the frontend that the call has ended and publishes the entity metadata to the websocket and stores the data into the DynamoDB table.
